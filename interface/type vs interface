==================== type ====================

1) literals can be defined with type only
ex: 
type breed = "Begal" | "Lab | "Husky 

2) Can not re-open and add new properties or function

3) We can not inherit aka: extends type 


==================== Interface ====================

1) literals can not be defined with interface

2) Can re-open and add new properties or function
ex:
interface Person {
  name: string,
}

interface Person {
  lastname: string
}

3) We can inherit aka: extends interfaces
ex: 
interface Person {
  name: string,
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  lastname: string
}

const joe: Employee = {
  name: "Joe",
  lastname: "Kate"
}

4) Interfaces are better when complexity is there its more readable, uable and inheritance makes it more powerful.
