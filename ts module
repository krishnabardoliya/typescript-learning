module in typescript

1) if there is no export all files in ts are global scope.
- If we provide export to any of the function we need to manually write import statement and import in required files.
also, need to add those script as type="module" to run on browser and run on server ex: lite-server to run on browser


2) if not using any import export, if working with index.html, file should be in correct order while including script


3) importing types
syntax of importing types, interfaces:
import type {Color} from './utils.js'; or import {type Color} from './utils.js';
