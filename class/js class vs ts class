// Difference between JS class vs Typescript class
// 1) type strict 
// 2) readonly
// 3) public and privte modifiers only availble in ts 
// readonly is for changable or not public private is for accessible or not for visibility.
// public - availble to access inside and outside of the class
// private - only able to access inside the class #name and private modifiers both do same job, just declaring private than adding # is more readable and clearly understandable is the difference.
// can not use private #shops = 2 both "private" modifier and "#" can not be used together.
